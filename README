2. Execute Maven as compiler with supporting of quickfix
3. Jump files between source/test code

Installation:

Please get the source and copy the source into your runtime path of VIM.
Then type "helptags ~/vimfiles/doc/" to build tags of help file.

Use "help maven.txt" to open the help of this plugin.

Limitation:

This plugin wouldn't read the content of "pom.xml" to setup the context of Maven project.
So you should setup directories of source code in your project by default.
